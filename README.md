# Intervention-2010

After reverence, i thought and thought.... and did it again but slower and genuine,
basically this is forked from a really old half life sdk and I'm improving it from there,
just like reverence there are alot of modernizations through the gunplay,visuals,movement and stuff like that,
its really WIP and MESSY but bear with me, this just a little personal project to see how my brain works.![Screenshot 2025-05-07 124324](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43b5e745-0ae1-43b7-b728-94d6bde3af45)


# Features??

There are stuff directly from reverence itself, some of those like fullbright textures need further modifications.

One of the main,important,highly invested features would be... per-vertex lighting...yes its here and not crashing, major credits to @Overfloater,
it uses elights and dlights from maps and events like battery light, flashlight, muzzleflash, "Per-vertex lighting is added by comparing the lights.rad file used by hlrad to the geometry and texture info of the BSP file".

features will be posted when i remember.. expect some source implementations.. going for that early extra early source look.
